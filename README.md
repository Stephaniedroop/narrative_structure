  <p style='text-align:left'>Klaas was a happy farmer's boy who lived with his parents and sisters on their cow farm.<br> \
They were neither poor nor rich and they always had enough to eat, but for some unknown reason \
Klaas could never get enough cheese. <br> One night at dinner Klaas had a hankering for cheese, as usual. \
This made him override the social norms of the family and pilfer a piece of cheese off his sister's plate. <br> \
Naturally this made his parents scold him. As a result, Klaas went to his bedroom in a bad mood.</p> \
<p style='text-align:left'>Out the window he saw a cluster of lights dancing under the pine trees.<br> \
Gradually, one of the lights came over to his window, entered the room and took the shape of a lovely girl. <br>\
She spoke and invited him, 'We have plenty of cheese! Come with us.' This made Klaas feel intrigued. <br>\
Therefore he left the house and set out for the pine woods and the fairy ring.</p> \
<p style='text-align:left'>When he got there he found dozens of beautiful fairies full of light, dancing. <br>\
They pulled him in to dance. Klaas danced with the fairies till he was exhausted. <br>\
His extreme tiredness made him flop down on the grass.</p> \
<p style='text-align:left'>Then the fairy dancers brought him offerings of cheese to eat. <br>\
This put Klaas in ecstasy! He gorged himself on as much cheese as he had ever dreamed of. <br>\
Soon he got full and had to stop eating.\
But the fairies kept bringing hundreds of different cheeses and making him eat. <br>\
They piled cheese up round him like the walls of a house. \
This terrified Klaas and made him desperate for the horror to end. \
But the fairies were indefatigable. <br> The huge pile of cheese grew and grew and suddenly fell in on Klaas and crushed him. \
Klaas screamed and woke up.</p>\
<p style='text-align:left'>He was alone in the field in the early dawn, wet with dew. \
In his mouth was a bunch of grass which he had been chewing.</p>\

They were neither poor nor rich and they always had enough to eat, but Klaas always wanted more cheese.</p> \
<p style='text-align:left'>One night at dinner Klaas was on the lookout for cheese, as usual. \
  His desire for cheese prompted him to override the social norms of the family, \
  and he pilfered a piece of cheese off his sister's plate. <br>\
  His parents naturally wanted to restore order and raise prosocial children, so they scolded Klaas.<br> \
  Klaas went to his bedroom to mope and feel sorry for himself. </p>\
<p style='text-align:left'>Out the window he saw a cluster of lights dancing under the pine trees. <br>\
  Gradually, one of the lights came over to his window, entered the room and took the shape of a lovely girl. <br>\

  Klaas was enticed by the promise of cheese, and intrigued by the idea of adventure. \
  So he left the house and set out for the pine woods and the fairy ring.</p>\
  <p style='text-align:left'>When he got there he found dozens of beautiful fairies full of light, dancing. <br>\
  They pulled him in to dance. Who knows why they took such interest in a local human boy; \
  fairies have their own reasons. <br> Klaas danced with the fairies till he was exhausted. \
  He wanted to rest so flopped down on the grass.</p>\
  <p style='text-align:left'>Then the fairy dancers brought him offerings of cheese to eat. <br>\
  Klaas was in ecstasy and gorged himself on as much cheese as he had ever dreamed of. <br>\

  <p style='text-align:left'>Once upon a time, there was a happy little girl who lived with her parents in a cottage \
where the woods bordered the kingdom. <br> After many happy years, the little girl's mother died.</p> \
<p style='text-align:left'>As a result, the little girl's father hastily remarried. Sadly, he died shortly after his marriage.<br> \
The little girl's stepmother was very bitter, and treated the girl as a servant for her and her daughters \
from a previous marriage.</p>\
<p style='text-align:left'>One day the king decided his son, the prince, should marry. <br>\
  Therefore he planned a majestic ball and everyone was invited. Because she had also received the general invitation, \
  Cinderella made herself a modest dress. <br> Because Cinderella's stepsisters were jealous of her natural grace and beauty, \
  they destroyed Cinderella's dress, causing her to cry alone in the woods. </p>\
<p style='text-align:left'>Moved by the girl's tragic circumstances, \
  her fairy godmother appeared and helped. <br> Her magic transformed Cinderella's rags into a beautiful ballgown with \
  glass slippers, and provided other accessories too. <br> \
  Thanks to this intervention, Cinderella could attend the ball as the most stylish person there. <br> \
  The transformation would only last until midnight. Cinderella attended the ball.</p>\
<p style='text-align:left'>While there, she caught the eye of the prince. The prince had never seen this radiant goddess before and was intrigued. <br>\
  They danced. The prince found Cinderella absolutely charming and fell in love with her. <br>\
  As midnight struck, Cinderella fled. In the process she lost a glass slipper.</p>\
<p style='text-align:left'>Because he was so in love, the prince began a systematic search to find her. <br> \
Cinderella's stepmother heard of the prince's search. \
Because her suspicions were raised when she saw Cinderella's other slipper, she locked Cinderella in her room. <br> \
The prince tried the glass slipper on the stepsisters but it didn't fit. \
He insisted that any other women present try it on too. <br> \
The prince's imperious manner forced the sisters to free Cinderella. \
She tried the shoe, which fit. She also had the other shoe as proof. <br> \
Cinderella and the prince got married and lived happily ever after.</p>\

  <p style='text-align:left'>Once a man had a donkey, which was getting old. The man considered getting rid of the donkey because it \
was infirm and couldn't work any more, and he couldn't afford to feed it. <br> The donkey sensed this, so ran away. \
'Maybe I could become a musician,' he thought. <br> On the road he found a dog gasping, and asked him what was wrong.\
'I'm getting old,' replied the dog, 'so my owner planned to put me down. That is why I ran away.' <br> \
'That's a good reason to come with me,' said the donkey, 'You can join my band.' <br> The dog agreed, and on they went.</p>\
<p style='text-align:left'>Later they met a cat. Same story: <br> 'Hunting mice is too hard work, so I just sit by the fire', said the cat, \
'My owner doesn't like that so was going to drown me. So I ran away.' <br> \
'Come with us and make music!' the others suggested. <br> \
This idea pleased the cat, so he joined them. </p>\
<p style='text-align:left'>Next the three came to a farmyard, where a cockerel was \
crowing his heart out. <br> 'What's wrong?' they asked. <br>  \
'I heard the cook planning to cut off my head and put me in soup! What other choice did I have but to run away!?' <br> \
'You have a good voice,' said the donkey, 'Come with us and make music!' <br> \
The cockerel agreed, and all four went on together. </p>\
<p style='text-align:left'>Towards night they came upon a house. They looked in the window, and saw a table of lovely food and drink, \
with a band of robbers sitting round it enjoying a meal. <br> \
The animals were tired from the road and so hatched a plan to drive away the robbers. <br> \
At a signal they all began to perform their music together. <br> The donkey brayed, the hound barked, \
the cat yowled, and the cockerel crowed; then they burst through the window into the room, spraying broken glass everywhere! </p>\
<p style='text-align:left'>The din was so horrible that the robbers fled in a great fright out into the forest to escape what they thought \
was a ghost. <br> With the robbers gone, the four companions could sit down at the table and eat heartily. <br> \
When they had finished eating, they put out the light, and because each had a different nature, \
they each found a different cosy place to sleep.</p>\
<p style='text-align:left'>Later, after realising they had been foolish to get scared away, the robbers came back to see what was really going on. <br> \
The house was quiet and dark so they felt heartened and went in to resume their meal. \
But they tripped over all the sleeping animals. <br> This woke the four animals and made them spring up in a rage. \
They attacked the robbers with their claws, teeth and hooves.</p>\
<p style='text-align:left'> At this the robbers knew the house was truly haunted so they ran away to find somewhere else to live, \
leaving the house forever to the four happy musicians. </p>\

  <p style='text-align:left'>In a far away land, a king and queen had a lovely little daughter. \
    They had been so desperate for a child that they were unable to refuse her anything. <br> \

      the princess said she would only help if the queen gave her the crown. She shouted and demanded, \
      and insulted her mother. <br> This hurt the queen. It made her feel weary and sad. So she gave the girl the crown. </p>\
    <p style='text-align:left'>At the same time, the king was reading the newspaper when he dropped his glasses. \
      He called his daughter to help him look for them. <br> According to her spoilt nature, \

    <p style='text-align:left'>But because the crown was too big for her, it slipped down her face and covered her whole head. <br> \
      So she couldn't get it off. This frightened the princess so she started crashing about blindly, and because she couldn't see she started \
      breaking things. <br> She realised she wouldn't be able to eat or drink and so she panicked. </p>\
    <p style='text-align:left'>As if out of nowhere an old woman appeared and wondered what was going on. <br> \
      The princess called for help and promised the whole palace and all the jewels if the woman could help get the crown off. <br> \
      The woman wouldn't help until the princess had acknowledged how badly she had treated her parents. </p>\
    <p style='text-align:left'>This episode chastened the princess and brought her to her senses. <br> \
      As a result she went to find her parents and beg forgiveness, look after them and enjoy their company. They reconciled. <br>\
