Welcome to our project, narrative_structure.

Here you will find details of the stimuli:
1. text of the stories, 
2. each tale's event timelines, and 
3. details of the events chosen as manipulation in experiment 1 as part of an Individual Project for the course Doing Research in NLP, April 2022.

**Glossary**

Some words are used in a specific sense in talking about this project.

They are:

Aspect: the slant or angle taken on a tale, to make a story. In practice this is either Cause or Intention. aka Condition.

Story: a specific text version of a tale. Each tale was manipulated to emphasise either Cause or Intention. So for each tale there is a Cause story and an Intention story.

Tale: a fairy story chosen as stimuli for this project. The event sequence remains the same across each story of each tale.
